Python package
==============

This package is organized to make it as easy as possible to add new
extensions and support the continued growth and coverage of
textract. For almost all applications, you will just have to do
something like this::

    import textract
    text = textract.process('path/to/file.extension')

to obtain text from a document.

For completeness, we also include here the documentation for specific
file extension parsers as well as a few other essential bits in the
``textract.exceptions`` and ``textract.shell`` module.
