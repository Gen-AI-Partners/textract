textract
================================

As undesireable as it might be, more often than not there is extremely
useful information embedded in Word documents, PowerPoint
presentations, PDFs, etc---so-called "dark data"---that would be
valuable for further textual analysis and visualization. While
:ref:`several packages <supporting>` exist for extracting content from
each of these formats on their own, this package provides a single
interface for extracting content from any type of file, without any
irrelevant markup.

This package provides two primary facilities for doing this, the
:ref:`command line interface <command-line-interface>`

.. code-block:: bash

    textract path/to/file.extension

or the :ref:`python package <python-package>`

.. code-block:: python

    # some python file
    import textract
    text = textract.process("path/to/file.extension")
